AGENT++ V4.5.1 README
=====================

Within this repo the source code and examples for AGENT++ 4.x for Linux,
Windows 7/10, Mac OSX, Cygwin, and many other operating systems
(including some embedded).

For more details on the API, please refer to the API specification.

This library requires SNMP++v3.4.7 or later!

SNMP++ up to 2.8 was designed by Peter Mellquist (Hewlett Packard Co.) and was
available from http://rosegarden.external.hp.com/snmp++. This link no longer
works because HP discontinued SNMP++! You can download the patched version 2.8a
still from http://www.agentpp.com/snmp++v2.8a.tar.gz.

====================================================================

USAGE:

  cmake -S . -B ../build -G Ninja


--
This is a **fork** with working *cmake build system* from Claus Klein.

It is based on the broken original version from Frank Fock https://agentpp.com
